## Summary

### Introduction
Apprenda created and maintains this reference architecture guide to relay our recommendations for running production instances of the the Apprenda Cloud Platform.  Apprenda is a datacenter software platform that empowers any organization to operate a self-service cloud computing platform for building, deploying, and running existing (legacy) and modern cloud native applications. Apprenda can be deployed on public, private, or hybrid infrastructure configurations.  Whether your deployment of Apprenda serves as a private PaaS within a large organization, a hosting platform for cloud-based SaaS applications, or you are operating a managed service platform (all are valid uses of the technology), you’ll find useful and relevant planning information in these documents.

### Who Should Read This Reference Guide?
This document is intended for enterprise IT departments, cloud/managed service providers, hosting companies, and ISVs who intend to deploy and operate an Apprenda Cloud Platform instance.  The information contained in this document will help you make hardware and software decisions to provision and configure the recommended initial footprint of an Apprenda-based solution.  We’ve taken into consideration basic high availability needs, with the expectation that the footprint will expand over time as developers onboard applications.  The information in this document should be shared with the persons responsible for:

* Machine installation and configuration
* Operating Systems
* Networking (firewalls, DNS, etc)
* Security
* CI/CD
* Change Management
* Reliability Engineering
* Databases
